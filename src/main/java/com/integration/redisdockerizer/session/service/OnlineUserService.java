/**
 * Service to manage the online/offline status of users using Redis.
 * <p>This service provides operations to track users' online status and activity. It uses Redis to store
 * information about whether a user is currently online and their last active time. The online status is managed
 * with a Time-To-Live (TTL), so users are automatically marked offline after a specified period of inactivity.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Features:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Mark users online/offline:</b> Allows marking users as online or offline based on their activity.</li>
 *     <li><b>Refresh online TTL:</b> Resets the TTL for a userâ€™s online status to keep them online as long as they remain active.</li>
 *     <li><b>Track last active time:</b> Keeps track of the timestamp for each user's last activity.</li>
 *     <li><b>Retrieve all online users:</b> Returns a list of all users who are currently marked as online.</li>
 * </ul>
